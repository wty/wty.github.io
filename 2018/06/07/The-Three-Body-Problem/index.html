<p>Customer Review<br>5.0 out of 5 starsAbsolutely mind-blowing. Like nothing I’ve ever read. Highest recommendation!<br>ByBDWon November 9, 2016<br>Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase<br>This is the most impactful sci-fi series I’ve ever read. What I mean by that, is that this series has permanently changed: the way I look at the stars, the way I perceive time, the way I think about life, the way I think about SETI, the way I think about the meaning of life, the way I think about human beings’ place in the universe, the way I view technology, etc.</p>
<p>This series well and truly “blew my mind away”. This isn’t a page0-turning space opera adventure kind of story. The story is interesting and good, and there is most definitely some drama and entertainment - and the writing is excellent (translation to English is superb). But the main thing for me about this series is that it educated me about physics and really made me look at EVERYTHING through a new lens. The ideas in this book I had never encountered before - and I am a voracious reader. I found this series to be totally original and mind-blowing. There were time where I simply needed to put it down after reading only a short time, in order to simply ponder the ideas presented. I’ve never had quite an experience like this with a book.</p>

Glickon June 5, 2018<br>Format: Kindle Edition<br>Interesting story. A true blend of science and fiction with the added twist of being written and centered from the Republic of China’s world view.

It gets a bit hokey at the end, so I doubt I will read the others.<br>Helpful<br>Not Helpful<br>|Comment|Report abuse<br>3.0 out of 5 starsA bit difficult to access<br>ByPeter Ryanon May 31, 2018<br>Format: Kindle Edition<br>This was an odd one to be honest. An excellent premise but a strangely laid out plot. The dialogue was wooden and quite expository, and most of the characters, with the exception of one police officer, were lightly developed and not that easy to relate to. Much of the story seemed to lurch from section to section without flow, only to be retro-explained later in the chapter. The Three-Body Problem is not a bad book by any means, just a little difficult to access.<br>Helpful<br>Not Helpful<br>|Comment|Report abuse<br>5.0 out of 5 starsI loved the technical and scientific details throughout the story as …<br>ByAmazon Customeron May 31, 2018<br>Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase<br>Such a creative mind!

I just finished reading the Old Man’s War saga, and stumbled on this trilogy. All the SF I had read up until then was American centered, so this book was a very refreshing change. The perspective is enlightening, and the language and images are perfectly crafted. Beautiful book, with a fast paced, mystery ridden plot that keeps you awake long hours at night.
